# TopDownPsuedoRandomSidescroller2015
Sample Code from a Project where I experimented with generating 2D tile sprite environments for a sidescrolling game.  

Seeing the results of implementing basic roguelike algorithms like "Flood Fill" and "Drunkard Walk" was fun.
My favorite portions of the project are in WorldManager.cs, WorldMap.cs, and CloudManager.cs
